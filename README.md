# Blackjack Application

This application is based on the running exercise on the *Javascript: Getting Started* course on pluralsight.

I plan to continue adding features to the basic application provided on the course so feel free to [file new issues/request](https://github.com/ejayledesma/blackjack-application/issues/new) to help make this a full blackjack application. For ongoing efforts, visit the [issues page](https://github.com/ejayledesma/blackjack-application/issues).
